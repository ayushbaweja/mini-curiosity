# TODOs 

- Evaluate ICM forward and inverse losses; confirm they match Pathak et al.
- Tune FrozenLake 8x8 hyperparameters (entropy bonus, rollout length, timesteps).
- Investigate adding stochastic noise to dynamics / observation stream.
- Interpret baseline vs ICM results (forward-only vs full ICM).
- Draft report and visualisations.
